\usage{
\S4method{prevalence}{SimInf_pfilter}(model, formula, level, index, format = c("data.frame", "matrix"))
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{the \code{SimInf_pfilter} object to extract the
prevalence from.}

\item{formula}{A formula that specifies the compartments that
define the cases with a disease or that have a specific
characteristic (numerator), and the compartments that define
the entire population of interest (denominator). The
left-hand-side of the formula defines the cases, and the
right-hand-side defines the population, for example,
\code{I~S+I+R} in a \sQuote{SIR} model (see
\sQuote{Examples}). The \code{.}  (dot) is expanded to all
compartments, for example, \code{I~.}  is expanded to
\code{I~S+I+R} in a \sQuote{SIR} model (see
\sQuote{Examples}). The formula can also contain a condition
(indicated by \code{|}) for each node and time step to further
control the population to include in the calculation, for
example, \code{I ~ . | R == 0} to calculate the prevalence
when the recovered is zero in a \sQuote{SIR} model. The
condition must evaluate to \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} in each
node and time step. Note that if the denominator is zero, the
prevalence is \code{NaN}.}

\item{level}{The level at which the prevalence is calculated at
each time point in \code{tspan}. 1 (population prevalence):
calculates the proportion of the individuals (cases) in the
population. 2 (node prevalence): calculates the proportion of
nodes with at least one case. 3 (within-node prevalence):
calculates the proportion of cases within each node. Default
is \code{1}.}

\item{index}{indices specifying the subset of nodes to include
when extracting data. Default (\code{index = NULL}) is to
extract data from all nodes.}

\item{format}{The default (\code{format = "data.frame"}) is to
generate a \code{data.frame} with one row per time-step with
the prevalence. Using \code{format = "matrix"} returns the
result as a matrix.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} if \code{format = "data.frame"}, else
    a matrix.
