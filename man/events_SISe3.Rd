}
\details{
Example data to initialize scheduled events (see
\code{\linkS4class{SimInf_events}}) for a population of 1600 nodes
and demonstrate the \code{\linkS4class{SISe3}} model. The dataset
contains 783773 events for 1600 nodes distributed over 4 * 365
days. The events are divided into three types: \sQuote{Exit}
events remove individuals from the population (n = 182535),
\sQuote{Enter} events add individuals to the population (n =
182685), sQuote{Internal transfer} events move individuals between
compartmens within one node e.g. ageing (n = 317081), and
\sQuote{External transfer} events move individuals between nodes
in the population (n = 101472). The vignette contains a detailed
description of how scheduled events operate on a model.
