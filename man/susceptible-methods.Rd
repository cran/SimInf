\usage{
susceptible(model, ...)

\S4method{susceptible}{SISe}(model, i = NULL, by = 1, ...)

\S4method{susceptible}{SISe3}(model, age = 1:3, i = NULL, by = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The \code{model} to extract the susceptible from}

\item{...}{Additional arguments affecting the measure}

\item{i}{Indices specifying the nodes to include when extracting
the number of susceptible. Default is NULL, which includes all
nodes.}

\item{by}{The number to increment the sequence of time points
starting from 1. Default is 1, which gives the number of
susceptible at every time point.}

\item{age}{For models with age categories, the age category to
extract.}
}

Extracts the number of susceptible
}
\examples{
## Create a 'SISe' demo model with 5 nodes and initialize
## it to run over 10 days.
model <- demo_model(nodes = 5, days = 10, model = "SISe")

## Run the model and save the result
result <- run(model)

## Extract the number of susceptible individuals in each
## node after each time step in the simulation
susceptible(result)

## Extract the number of susceptible individuals in the
## first node after each time step in the simulation
susceptible(result, i = 1)

## Extract the number of susceptible individuals in the
## first and third node after each time step in the simulation
susceptible(result, i = c(1, 3))

## Extract the number of susceptible individuals in the first
## and third node after every other time step in the simulation
susceptible(result, i = c(1, 3), by = 2)

## Create a 'SISe3' demo model with 5 nodes and initialize
## it to run over 10 days.
model <- demo_model(nodes = 5, days = 10, model = "SISe3")

## Run the model and save the result
result <- run(model)

## Extract the sum all of susceptible individuals in all age
## categories in each node after each time step in the simulation
susceptible(result)

## Extract the number of susceptible individuals in the first age
## category in each node after each time step in the simulation
susceptible(result, age = 1)

## Extract the sum of susceptible individuals in the first and
## second age category in each node after each time step in
## the simulation
susceptible(result, age = c(1, 2))

## Extract the number of susceptible individuals in the first age
## category in the first and third node after each time step in
## the simulation
susceptible(result, i = c(1, 3), age = 1)
