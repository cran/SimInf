\title{Create an \acronym{SEIR} model}
\usage{
SEIR(u0, tspan, events = NULL, beta = NULL, epsilon = NULL,
  gamma = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{u0}{A \code{data.frame} with the initial state in each node
(see \sQuote{Details}).}

\item{tspan}{A vector (length >= 2) of increasing time points
where the state of each node is to be returned. Can be either
an \code{integer} or a \code{Date} vector. A \code{Date}
vector is coerced to a numeric vector as days, where
\code{tspan[1]} becomes the day of the year of the first year
of \code{tspan}. The dates are added as names to the numeric
vector.}

\item{events}{a \code{data.frame} with the scheduled events, see
\code{\link{SimInf_model}}.}

\item{beta}{The transmission rate from susceptible to exposed.}

\item{epsilon}{The incubation rate from exposed to infected.}

\item{gamma}{The recovery rate from infected to recovered.}
}
\value{
\code{SEIR}
}
\description{
Create an \acronym{SEIR} model to be used by the simulation
framework.
}
\details{
The \acronym{SEIR} model contains four compartments; number of
susceptible (S), number of exposed (E) (those who have been
infected but are not yet infectious), number of infectious (I),
and number of recovered (R).  Moreover, it has three state
transitions,

\deqn{S \stackrel{\beta S I / N}{\longrightarrow} E}{S -- beta S I / N --> E}
\deqn{E \stackrel{\epsilon E}{\longrightarrow} I}{E -- epsilon E --> I}
\deqn{I \stackrel{\gamma I}{\longrightarrow} R}{I -- gamma I --> R}

where \eqn{\beta} is the transmission rate, \eqn{\epsilon} is the
incubation rate, \eqn{\gamma} is the recovery rate, and
\eqn{N=S+E+I+R}.

The argument \code{u0} must be a \code{data.frame} with one row for
each node with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{S}{The number of sucsceptible in each node}
\item{E}{The number of exposed in each node}
\item{I}{The number of infected in each node}
\item{R}{The number of recovered in each node}
}
}
\examples{
## Create a SEIR model object.
model <- SEIR(u0 = data.frame(S = 99, E = 0, I = 1, R = 0),
              tspan = 1:100,
              beta = 0.16,
              epsilon = 0.25,
              gamma = 0.077)

## Run the SEIR model and plot the result.
set.seed(3)
result <- run(model)
plot(result)
}
