\title{Create an \acronym{SEIR} model}
\usage{
SEIR(u0, tspan, events = NULL, beta = NULL, epsilon = NULL, gamma = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{u0}{A \code{data.frame} with the initial state in each node,
i.e., the number of individuals in each compartment in each
node when the simulation starts (see \sQuote{Details}). The
parameter \code{u0} can also be an object that can be coerced
to a \code{data.frame}, e.g., a named numeric vector will be
coerced to a one row \code{data.frame}.}

\item{tspan}{A vector (length >= 1) of increasing time points
where the state of each node is to be returned. Can be either
an \code{integer} or a \code{Date} vector. A \code{Date}
vector is coerced to a numeric vector as days, where
\code{tspan[1]} becomes the day of the year of the first year
of \code{tspan}. The dates are added as names to the numeric
vector.}

\item{events}{a \code{data.frame} with the scheduled events, see
\code{\link{SimInf_model}}.}

\item{beta}{A numeric vector with the transmission rate from
susceptible to infected where each node can have a different
beta value. The vector must have length 1 or \code{nrow(u0)}.
If the vector has length 1, but the model contains more nodes,
the beta value is repeated in all nodes.}

\item{epsilon}{A numeric vector with the incubation rate from
exposed to infected where each node can have a different
epsilon value. The vector must have length 1 or
\code{nrow(u0)}.  If the vector has length 1, but the model
contains more nodes, the epsilon value is repeated in all
nodes.}

\item{gamma}{A numeric vector with the recovery rate from infected
to recovered where each node can have a different gamma
value. The vector must have length 1 or \code{nrow(u0)}. If
the vector has length 1, but the model contains more nodes,
the beta value is repeated in all nodes.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{SimInf_model}} of class \code{SEIR}
}
\description{
Create an \acronym{SEIR} model to be used by the simulation
framework.
}
\details{
The \acronym{SEIR} model contains four compartments; number of
susceptible (S), number of exposed (E) (those who have been
infected but are not yet infectious), number of infectious (I),
and number of recovered (R).  Moreover, it has three state
transitions,

\deqn{S \stackrel{\beta S I / N}{\longrightarrow} E}{
  S -- beta S I / N --> E}
\deqn{E \stackrel{\epsilon E}{\longrightarrow} I}{E -- epsilon E --> I}
\deqn{I \stackrel{\gamma I}{\longrightarrow} R}{I -- gamma I --> R}

where \eqn{\beta} is the transmission rate, \eqn{\epsilon} is the
incubation rate, \eqn{\gamma} is the recovery rate, and
\eqn{N=S+E+I+R}.

The argument \code{u0} must be a \code{data.frame} with one row for
each node with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{S}{The number of sucsceptible in each node}
\item{E}{The number of exposed in each node}
\item{I}{The number of infected in each node}
\item{R}{The number of recovered in each node}
}
}
\examples{
## Create a SEIR model object.
model <- SEIR(u0 = data.frame(S = 99, E = 0, I = 1, R = 0),
              tspan = 1:100,
              beta = 0.16,
              epsilon = 0.25,
              gamma = 0.077)

## Run the SEIR model and plot the result.
set.seed(3)
result <- run(model)
plot(result)
}
