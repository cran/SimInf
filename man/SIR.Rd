\title{Create an \acronym{SIR} model}
\usage{
SIR(u0, tspan, events = NULL, beta = NULL, gamma = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{u0}{A \code{data.frame} with the initial state in each node,
i.e., the number of individuals in each compartment in each
node when the simulation starts (see \sQuote{Details}). The
parameter \code{u0} can also be an object that can be coerced
to a \code{data.frame}, e.g., a named numeric vector will be
coerced to a one row \code{data.frame}.}

\item{tspan}{A vector (length >= 1) of increasing time points
where the state of each node is to be returned. Can be either
an \code{integer} or a \code{Date} vector. A \code{Date}
vector is coerced to a numeric vector as days, where
\code{tspan[1]} becomes the day of the year of the first year
of \code{tspan}. The dates are added as names to the numeric
vector.}

\item{events}{a \code{data.frame} with the scheduled events, see
\code{\link{SimInf_model}}.}

\item{beta}{A numeric vector with the transmission rate from
susceptible to infected where each node can have a different
beta value. The vector must have length 1 or \code{nrow(u0)}.
If the vector has length 1, but the model contains more nodes,
the beta value is repeated in all nodes.}

\item{gamma}{A numeric vector with the recovery rate from infected
to recovered where each node can have a different gamma
value. The vector must have length 1 or \code{nrow(u0)}. If
the vector has length 1, but the model contains more nodes,
the beta value is repeated in all nodes.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{SimInf_model}} of class \code{SIR}
}
\description{
Create an \acronym{SIR} model to be used by the simulation
framework.
}
\details{
The \acronym{SIR} model contains three compartments; number of
susceptible (S), number of infectious (I), and number of
recovered (R).  Moreover, it has two state transitions,
\deqn{S \stackrel{\beta S I / N}{\longrightarrow} I}{
  S -- beta S I / N --> I}
\deqn{I \stackrel{\gamma I}{\longrightarrow} R}{I -- gamma I --> R}
where \eqn{\beta} is the transmission rate, \eqn{\gamma} is the
recovery rate, and \eqn{N=S+I+R}.

The argument \code{u0} must be a \code{data.frame} with one row for
each node with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{S}{The number of sucsceptible in each node}
\item{I}{The number of infected in each node}
\item{R}{The number of recovered in each node}
}
}
\examples{
## Create an SIR model object.
model <- SIR(u0 = data.frame(S = 99, I = 1, R = 0),
             tspan = 1:100,
             beta = 0.16,
             gamma = 0.077)

## Run the SIR model and plot the result.
set.seed(22)
result <- run(model)
plot(result)
}
